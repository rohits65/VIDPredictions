PURPOSE: Analyze differences between R0 in outbreak progression.

Data files varied R0, as per the file names and INFO messages in the files.

R0 of 1 to 6 were used to produce a data set to model infection.

No incubation period. Illness lasted 5 days. 

Population was 10,000.


ANALYSIS: The curve of new cases per day was significantly flatened when the r0 was equal to 2. As a result, if social distancing
reduces the r0 value, then it is an effective measure to 'flatten' the curve. Furthermore, the percentage of the total propulation 
affected decreases as the r0 decreases, although less severely.
