PURPOSE: The effect of randomizing r0 within a predifined range (while maintaining the average) on the progression of the curve.

Data files all used and r0 = 3 for the index case, but the files either used a range of 2-4, 1-5, or 3-3 for subsequent cases.

No incubation period. Illness lasted 5 days.

Population was 10,000. 1,000 simulations were run per file.


ANALYSIS: The uncertainty interval was larger as the range increased, and that is expected as more r0 values will cause an increase 
in randomness. Overall, the average lines were almost the same, but 2-4 was slightly steeper, which is not statistically significant.
